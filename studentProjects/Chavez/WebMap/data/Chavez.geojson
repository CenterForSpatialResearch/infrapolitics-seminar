Moré would have been born during this time, his father coming from Mahad to Ladawali with a group of people following the pilgrimage. He uses the ritual to suggest untouchability was a practice imposed by upper caste Hindus and because this ritual is mostly a Mahar ritual, the lack of untouchability is a result of the lack of upper-caste influence. The image itself also invites us to consider how limited space might have also played a role in such suspension.", "href": "<a = href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N6ZU5gbB4_s>Click Here<\/a>", "image": "css\/images\/chabina_procession.jpg" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 73.4230508, 18.0774316 ] } },

It suggests an allegiance to the nation as the reason for why Mahars decided to join the army. Moré, however, explains the relationship between Mahars and the army as one about social mobility and survival since it was the only place where they could earn an income. Thus, the patriotism and nationalism of the postcard is put into question. Mahar enlistment might have been about having no other choice, rather than a desire to protect the nation.

Alibag was known throughout the Colaba district as a very orthodox and first-class misanthropic town. There even shadows were thought to be polluting. When we reached there we went to the home of a gentleman in the Mahar colony outside the town” (Moré, 10). The fact that More stays in the Mahar colony outside the town suggests the high degree of untochability practiced in Alibag, showing how different spaces demand different forms of negotiation given the social relations that constitute it. Unlike Tale and other villages he went to on his way to Alibag, Alibag's reputation for discrimination is well known and felt viscerally by More. Furthermore, the existence of the Mahar colony shows that people as infrastructure function in a feedbck loop with their physical spaces, adapating according to the conditions of discrimination of the area and adopting newcomers, helping them navigate it.", "href": "-", "image": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 72.8671, 18.6554 ] } },

The poster below, courtesy of Prof. Anupama Rao, is in current-day Mahad. In depicting Moré, it demonstrates the fondness with which the activist and his work are remembered, sustaining his claim that his education was a success for the entire anti-caste movement. Moré changed the built environment of Mahad through his tea-shop and connected the village with organizined Dalit activism in Bombay through the 1927 conference. The poster is thus a testament of the constitutive power More's presence had in the history of Mahad. He becomes a symbol for shared social aspirations.", "href": "<a=href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india\/from-mahad-to-mumbai-to-hyderabad-the-story-of-india-s-caste-blues\/story-ggYqaHOin82umAKX650GVN.html\">Click Here<\/a>", "image": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 73.417, 18.083 ] } },

If anyone tormented the poor too much, he would teach them a lesson. He had a kind of hold over the khot moneylenders. The police could never lay their hands on him” (23). The Robin-Hood-esque description at this moment in the narrative is striking in its lack of concern about caste. Instead, the focus on stealing from the rich to serve the poor suggests an understanding of the 'nobleness' of the act coming from the way it addresses a form of class exploitation. When Moré meets the thief, we can see his complex intertwinement of caste-class that develops out of More's own lived experience. Recognizing class exploitation as part and parcel of anti-caste thought also allows Moré to have a variety of actors beyond other Mahars involved in the people as infrastructure.", "href": "-", "image": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 73.365, 18.1128 ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Latitude": 18.5685, "Longitude": 73.8459, "Title": "Alegaonkar High School", "Text": "When Moré enrolls back in school, he exhibits a behavior that repeats the logic of respectability with classist undertones that he expressed in Bombay while rehearsing in Haji Bandar, 'Some of the persons working with me at the Arsenal had become my friends. Now to these were added friends from among the students of the Alegaonkars’ school. Some of these friends liked to go and see tamashas and plays. Some loved to sing bhajans, some liked gambling and playing cards, while others had a liking for physical exercise, running and other sports. I spent what time I could with all of them and won their affection. Because of their company I picked up some bad habits. But I did not become addicted to them. The reading I had done earlier and and the company of saintly persons had given me a meditative nature…From the time I began to go to night school, I avoided spending too much time with my friends who were fond of tamashas, plays, cards, and gambling. Gradually I became detached from all these things' (36). The subtlety of his comment lies in the fact that he does not deem as not worth helping those who he sees as doing bad things. He does not even dismiss them as friends. However, there is a degree of distance in which they are narrated in relation to him, a distance that seems contradictory given that it is the people around him who were playing cards and not attending school who helped me survive during his stay in Pune. People who were not educating themselves were the ones who helped him access the hospital when he broke his leg while in the arsenal. This is a specific location where we see how his idea of education and its transformative power motivate him moving forward but also create a form of tunnel vision that prevent him to appreciate the legitimacy of under lifestyles, under ways of battling untouchability that have helped him carry on his particular tactic.", "href": "-", "image": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 73.8459, 18.5685 ] } },

It shows that alongside the freedom movement, there were other struggles that would go on to determine the post-Independence history of India. Mahad is also the chronicle of caste in the country and its clashes and intersections with the struggles and ambitions of the Left --- a story that foretells the still unfolding narrative of the movement around the social boycott and death of the Hyderabad University student Rohith Vemula.'

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Latitude": 18.9814365, "Longitude": 72.8496699, "Title": "Haji Bandar", "Text": "When describing Haji Bandar and the new social life the space allowed him to become a part of, Moré writes: 'When I started going to work at Haji Bandar I became familiar with some new areas of Bombay…Later on I began to go to these areas more and more often. This was because three of my new-found companions were taking part in the Kamleshwar Drama Company…The Batatyachi Chawl where our theatre room was located was in the Safed Galli (literally, white lane). This Safed Galli was a big centre of the prostitution business…Prostitutes lived in some of the rooms in Batatyachi Chawl and tamasha players and other people lived in the remaining rooms. My friends kept a distance from bad things. This was because they were educated and cultured. Their attraction to the art of the theatre can be said to be a sign of their being cultured. This was their way of trying to rise from a lower class to a higher class'(28-29). As seen on the map, Haji Bandar lies approximately 7km away from any other location previously mentioned by Moré within Bombay. It introduces him to a social life beyond the army that turns theater into a prominent activity that not only gives him pleasure but also a sense of 'rising to a higher class.' This 'rising,' however, implies a comparison with something inert, in this case those doing prostitution and other 'bad' things. The distancing himself is striking if thinking back on the thief. While he was able to retroactively understand the Charai thief through Marxism, he still deems those in the red district as 'bad,' suggesting a limit to his idea of 'good' that seems to follow a logic of respectability and to reproduce the inability of Marxism to imagine the revolutionary subject outside the urban proletariat. His class-caste expands some of the ideology limitations, but is not able to uphold other subjects outside the figure of the poor and the worker. The prostitute is still shamed for her actions, ignoring how sex is also labor.", "href": "-", "image": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 72.8496699, 18.9814365 ] } },

As seen from the image below depicting one of the types of work performed by Mahars and other Dalits on the docks, it demanded strenuous physical activity that forced people to work in close proximity with each other, exposing them to a wide array of people beyond the army such as other menial workers, merchants and travellers. The docks, however, are still in close proximity to the only other location Moré has described, Family Lines. It is only when he meets people through the docks that he is able to explore other areas of the city, farther away from the re-territorialized Mahar colony.

Despite his familiarity with new areas, he returns constantly to the same neighborhood in what is now South Colaba. The figures within the narrative are in a way geolocalized - they exist in a psychogeographic space that allow Moré to navigate and have a sense of knowledge about the city as he pursues his aspirations. The picture below, taken from Twitter, shows what the Tilak funeral procession was like in 1920. Moré was part of that crowd and from there went south rather than walking a block east to his family.

This location is therefore directly linked to the Mahar conference in Mahad, thus unsettling a clear distinction between rural and urban. The relationship between the hall and the conference demonstrates the way in which people as infrastructure navigates the rural-urban as a continuum in order to facilitate survival for select subjects. The picture below that depicts Ambedkar was taken during the conference, showing that Moré did end up convincing him to appear. It is also striking, however, how this picture shows only men, allowing us to question which bodies are allowed to become involved in an organized political movement and which don't under the label of Mahar.

This form of knowing space is undergirded by the way in which the army had throughout generations been a constitutive space for Mahar identity and even activism. The image below, courtesy of Anupama Rao, is from a 1905 request from a group of Mahars to the government, asking for increased acceptance into the ranks. The request argues for it on the basis of their ancestors' services, using a 'record of generations' to imply that good military service runs on the blood and the history of Mahars. The document shows how previous generations passed down the knowledge of what's possible in terms of economic achievement through the pensions they received after the service. It also shows how Mahars use the record of generational army service to negotiate a more equal social standing in society. It demonstrates how the army is a space of possibility for a Mahar political identity and how it is a truth passed down by generations. It is a long-established path that gives Moré a survival strategy without relying on 'bad things.'", "href": "-", "image": "css\/images\/army_petition.JPG" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 73.8753419, 18.5224957 ] } }
